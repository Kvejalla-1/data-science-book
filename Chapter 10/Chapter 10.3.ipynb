    "# 10.3 The Grammar of Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar of graphics makes it easy to specify information-dense graphics. The key idea is to map \"aesthetics\" of a plot (e.g., color, size, $x$-axis, $y$-axis) to variables in the data set. Libraries based on the grammar of graphics include `ggplot2` in `R` and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) in Python. In this section, you will learn to use Altair to quickly make a complex graphic."

    "## Customizing Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plots above, we mapped variables to aesthetics by simply specifying the column names. Although this is convenient, it does not allow for further customization of the aesthetics. To customize an aesthetic, we have to use the verbose method of specifying the aesthetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each aesthetic has an associated Python class. The name of the class is usually just the name of the aesthetic, but capitalized. For example, the `x` aesthetic is associated with the `X` class, and the `color` aesthetic is associated with the `Color` class. The constructor for each class takes as arguments the name of a variable, along with any relevant customizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to change the $x$-axis limits to go from 0 to 4000, and we want the tick labels on the $y$-axis to print 4e+5 instead of 400,000. Here's how to do this in Altair."
