    "# Chapter 5.2 The Scikit-Learn API\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we implemented $k$-nearest neighbors from scratch. Now we will see how to implement it using [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), a Python library that makes it easy to train and use machine learning models. All models are trained using the exact same steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Declare the model.\n",
    "2. Fit the model to training data, consisting of both features $X$ and labels $y$.\n",
    "3. Use the model to predict the labels for new values of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at how we would use this API to train a model on the Ames housing data set to predict the 2011 price of the Old Town house from the previous section. Scikit-Learn assumes that the data has already been completely converted to  quantitative variables and that the variables have already been standardized (if desired). The code below reads in the data and does the necessary preprocessing. \n",

    "\n",
    "We constructed `X_train_std` and `x_new_std` above using just basic `pandas` operations. But it is also possible to have Scikit-Learn do this preprocessing for us. The preprocessing objects in Scikit-Learn all follow the same basic pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the preprocessing object has to be \"fit\" to a data set.\n",
    "2. The `.transform()` method actually processes the data. This method can be called repeatedly on different data sets and is guaranteed to process each data set in exactly the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might not be obvious why it is necessary to first \"fit\" the preprocessing object to a data set before using it to process data. Hopefully, the following examples will make this clear.\n",

    "### Example 1: Dummy Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using `pd.get_dummies()`, we can do dummy encoding in Scikit-Learn using the `DictVectorizer` tool. There is one catch: `DictVectorizer` expects the data as a list of dictionaries, not as a `DataFrame`. But each row of a `DataFrame` can be represented as a dictionary, where the keys are the column names and the values are the data. `Pandas` provides a convenience function, `.to_dict()`, that converts a `DataFrame` into a list of dictionaries."
