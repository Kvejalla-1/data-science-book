    "# Chapter 14.2 Dot Maps\n",
    "\n",
    "A **dot map** is a way to visualize the locations of events in space. In a dot map, points are added to a map to represent the geographic location of some event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most important dot map ever is John Snow's map of the cholera cases during the 1854 London cholera outbreak. At the time, the cause of cholera was unknown. Snow's dot map showed that the cholera cases were centered around a particular water pump, the Broad Street pump. (In the days before running water, residents had to fetch water from the local water pump.) Snow's dot map is shown below; each \"dot\" is a thin black box. The boxes are stacked to indicate the number of residents could have contracted cholera. As a result, the data appear as black bars of different heights at this resolution, but if you zoom in, then you can see the individual \"dots\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![](cholera.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Snow followed up on this insight by interviewing residents near the Broad Street pump. He found that everyone who had contracted cholera had consumed water from the Broad Street pump; those who lived near the pump but did not contract cholera got their water from a different pump. Thus, with one simple dot map, John Snow established that cholera was transmitted through water."
