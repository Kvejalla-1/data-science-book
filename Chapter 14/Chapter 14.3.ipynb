    "\n",
    "A **choropleth** is a map in which areas are colored according to some statistic of interest. Perhaps the most familiar example of a choropleth is the presidential election map, which shows the percentage in each county who voted for the Democratic or Republican candidate. In this graphic, the areal units are counties, and the statistic of interest is the percentage who voted for the Democratic (or Republican) candidate. \n",

A `Patch` is simply a 2-dimensional object with an edge color and face color. Examples of `Patch`es include `Circle`s, `Rectangle`s, and `Polygon`s. Since areal units---like countries, states, and counties---are polygons in general, the most important type of `Patch` for making a choropleth is the `Polygon`.
