But what if we only wanted to know the age distribution of just the male passengers on the Titanic? To answer such questions, we have to **slice** our data. That is, we have to filter the `DataFrame` to include only those rows where a variable (e.g., `sex`) is equal to a particular value (e.g., `\"male\"`). \n",
